            # Setting up tools
            
            * you can install additional tools for the command line 
            
            * to help you: package managers i.e. homebrew

            # Setting up tools > Homebrew
            
            * to start:
            
            --
                * visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
            --
                * follow download instructions
            --
                * this installs homebrew, a package manager for the command line

            For this course we will use a prepared version of paged.js that is ready to use out of the box and comes with some helpers.
            
            --
           
            To install on your computer:
            
            --
            
            * open a terminal window where you want your folder to live (cd to it or cmd + drag to terminal icon)
            
            * `git clone https://github.com/haw-type-design/web2print.git` 
            
            * now you will find a folder in the directory that you are in named `web2print`
            
            
            ---
            
            
            
            # Setting up tools 2
            
            Inside it you will find these manuals and a folder called `sample-file-structure`
            
            * copy an paste it somewhere
            
            * you can now start to work in the files `index.html` to set up your document
            
            * and inside the `css` folder you can work inside `print.css` and `screen.css` to affect the corresponding styles
            
            ---
            
            
            # A server on your machine
            
            your browser blocks some request when you access your site manually (i.e. opening your `index.html` in your browser)
            
            * Python to the help. Open a Terminal window at the source folder of your files (CMD + drag it to your Terminal):
                
                * `python3 -m http.server` to launch the server, which runs at `localhost:8000` in your browser
                
                * hit `^ + C` in your terminal to quit

            # Playing around
            
            * once embedded you can start to play around with paged.js
            
            * have a look at their demo repos [here](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pagedjs/starter-kits)
            
            * go and see the manual [here](../manual)
