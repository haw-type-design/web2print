# Contributing

You found an error, typo, bug, something not quite right, or you just want to add something? Great!
Here is how it works:
You have two options:

1. [File an issue](./issues) (please take a look first if it already exists)

2. Fork this repo, edit what you want changed and [file a pull request](./pulls), we will review and merge
