            --
            2. More advanced stuff

            3. Even more advanced stuff 

            --
            4. Extending

            ---

            # Starting

            * If you haven’t embedded paged.js into your site or do not know how to run a local server please head (here)[../installation]

            --

            * Up and running? Nice!

            ---

            # Starting

            * download or clone the example file structure which is set up (here)[../sample-file-structure]

            --

            * it includes to stylesheets in the `css` folder:

                * `style-print.css`
                * `style-web.css`

            --

            * we can start to define style rules for print and web separately from now on

            ---

            # Starting

            * In HTML we can make use of media queries, that define layout rules for specific media types (i.e. screen sizes.)
            
            * One of such rules is the `@media print {}` query, that is used when we try to print the page
            
            * All of our styles destined for print will go inside this media query

            * Next: let’s start to take a look at the anatomy of our pages:
            
            .remark-code-multi[```
            @page {
                size: 148mm 210mm;
                margin-top: 10mm;
                margin-right: 10mm;
                margin-bottom: 20mm;
                margin-left: 30mm;
            }
            ```]
            
            --
            
            * The `@page` rules in CSS allow us to specify what the page looks like, when we hit _print_
            
            * In this case, we defined the page size and its margins
            ---

            --
            
            * Since not all pages are the same, we can define different layout for left and right pages:
            
            .remark-code-multi[```
            @page:left {
                margin-right: 10mm;
                margin-left: 30mm;
            }
            @page:right {
                margin-right: 30mm;
                margin-left: 10mm;
            }
            ```]

            * You can also prepare pdfs for printing with bleed:
            
            .remark-code-multi[```
            @page {
                bleed: 3mm;
            }
            ```]
            
            and crop marks to better cut your printouts:
            
            .remark-code-multi[```
            @page {
                marks: crop;
            }
            ```]

            * paged.js uses pre-set margin boxes that are usable to fill in content

            * These can be targeted using the corresponding @-rule:
            
            
            .remark-code-multi[```
            @page: right {
                @top-right {

                }
            }
