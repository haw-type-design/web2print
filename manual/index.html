            # Starting

            * If you haven’t embedded paged.js into your site or do not know how to run a local server please head (here)[../installation]

            --

            * Up and running? Nice!

            # Starting

            * download or clone the example file structure which is set up (here)[../sample-file-structure]

            --

            * it includes to stylesheets in the `css` folder:

                * `style-print.css`
                * `style-web.css`

            --

            * we can start to define style rules for print and web separately from now on

            * Let’s start to take a look at the anatomy of our pages:
            
            .remark-code-multi[```
            @page {
                size: 148mm 210mm;
                margin-top: 10mm;
                margin-right: 10mm;
                margin-bottom: 20mm;
                margin-left: 30mm;
            }
            ```]
            
            --
            
            * The `@page` rules in CSS allow us to specify what the page looks like, when we hit _print_
            
            * In this case, we defined the page size and the page margins
